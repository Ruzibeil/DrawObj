# DrawObj
## use opengl to render obj </br>
## use a python script to process contents in Obj file, give a L-shape 3 for test</br>
## the content in obj  :</br>
> 'v' means vertex, postions </br>
> 'vn' means vertex normal</br>
> 'vt' means vertex texture coordinate </br>
> 'f' means face and its values means index of 'v','vn' and 'vt'</br>
## use C++ for read each face of Obj then  use opengl for drawing the 3D model </br>
## choose some angles for saving image by FreeImage
